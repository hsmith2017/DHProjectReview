# Signs@40 Project Review

## Intro

Signs@40 is a digital media project aimed at displaying the content from the feminist journal _Signs_ in an interactive and visual manner. All the data is organized into four modes of analysis: topic model, cocitation network graph, cover art conglomeration, and a table of contents. The site allows for collaboration and is transparent to the audience in the editorial board’s intentions and opinions about the site. The site is, for the most part, well-designed; however, some displays could be contextualized more. 

## Concept and Content         

Overall, Signs@40’s goal is achieved through the various tools available for viewing the data. The four tools—topic modelling, cocitation network graph, cover art conglomerate, and table of contents—effectively display the data in concordance with the purpose of the tool. 

The topic modelling tool thematically clusters words by topic, and vice versa. The authors state that [this portion of the site](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/#/about) uses “the results of a computer-assisted topic modeling technique to explore thematic and rhetorical patterns in the history of _Signs_ from its first issue in 1975 up until 2014.” The necessity of this tool is unclear, despite its fulfillment of its goal. The need for a tool that categorizes and organizes article tags and topics in this way is arguably superfluous without proper contextualization. 

The cocitation network graph was created to allow viewers to visualize the relationships between scholars’ literature. The dynamic nature of the cocitation graph allows users to see the whole span of interconnectedness in _Signs_ scholarship, while still providing a method by which users can view the impact of one author’s work individually. The [cover art conglomerate](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/cover-art/) shows a chronological evolution of _Signs_ cover art, to show the changes in “feminist aesthetic.” The cover art tool could be useful a researcher interested in the transition of art trends over time or how current feminist culture changes the representation of literature. The last tool, the table of contents, allows users to view _Signs_ articles by topic, instead of journal edition, and link directly to the article. This tool perfectly conceptualizes its goal with its function—it highlights recurring topics in Signs and does so in an organized and easy-to-use fashion. 


## Design and Technique

The overall design of the website serves the purpose to immortalize and commemorate the forty years _Signs_ has been in publication. It does so by converting text and scholarship into interactive digital media in a way that cannot be done offline.

The table of contents’ design is conducive to its purpose. As stated above, it lays out the information like a table of contents in a book, but provides additional resources for users to explore. It allows the user to easily ascertain its function and presents the data accordingly. Likewise, the cocitation network graph’s form supports its function. Using the network graph method, users can discover cross-scholarship relationships from a broad and narrow perspective. The cover art conglomeration also presents the data in an intuitive manner, allowing users to click on images to view more information or view all the images as a whole.

Some of the data, however, is not contextualized within the tool. While the data is interesting, the topic modelling page is visually cluttered and the transition between words and topics has no perceivable purpose. On the editorial comments page editors explain its value, but at face-value it does not seem necessary. 

Overall, despite the issues with the topic modelling tool, a site is the best choice to display the data. It is easier for users to find the journals they want based off topics and tags. It also allows for more unique interactions with the data by providing interactive methods for users to explore. 


## Collaboration and Documentation

Signs@40 excels at collaboration and documentation by providing thought-out comments from past, present, and future editors of _Signs_. As [expressed on the site](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/commentaries/), editors are able to critically reflect on the importance of the site and its uses:
>Former, current, and future editors of _Signs_, _Signs_ associate editors, and other experts in the field reflect on the changes in the journal's content over time, the changing contexts within which the journal is situated, and the role Signs has played, and continues to play, in shaping women's, gender, and feminist studies.

Through allowing future editors to reflect on the site, continuation and adaptation is ensured. Future editors described their investment in the site and what they envision the future of the site to look like. By including a tab on the main site where editors can publicly express their relationship with and thoughts on the site, the site encourages collaboration and documentation by all participating members. 


## Summary    

In sum, Signs@40 has a clear purpose, displays the data in an interesting and innovative manner, and allows for continuous accountability and collaboration. While topic modelling tool is questionable in its function, the other three tools effectively express their importance through their function. Signs@40 is, for the most part, a well thought-out and organized site.
